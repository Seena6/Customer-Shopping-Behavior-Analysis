# Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis – Python | MySQL | Power BI
# Overview

This project analyzes 3,900 customer transactions to understand shopping patterns, purchase behavior, product preferences, and factors influencing spending.

# Business Problem

Problem Statement

A retail company is trying to get a clearer picture of how its customers shop so it can improve sales, strengthen customer relationships, and encourage repeat purchases. Recently, the team has noticed shifts in buying patterns across different age groups, product categories, and shopping channels.

They want to understand which factors such as discounts, reviews, seasons, or even preferred payment methods influence customers the most when they decide to buy something or come back again.

The main question driving this analysis is:

“How can customer shopping data be used to spot trends, improve engagement, and support better marketing and product decisions?”

# Dataset Summary

Adults and Young Adults contribute the highest share of total revenue.

Customers with more than 5 previous purchases show a strong likelihood of being subscribers.

Express shipping users tend to spend more than standard shipping users.

Certain products rely heavily on discounts to drive purchases, while others perform well without them.

Top-selling products often align with those having higher review ratings.

Categories with strong repeat buying behavior stand out as core revenue drivers.

# Recommendations

Based on the analysis, a few strategies can help improve customer engagement and revenue:

Strengthen loyalty programs to convert returning buyers into long-term loyal customers.

Review the discount strategy, especially for items that don’t require heavy promotions.

Highlight top-rated products in campaigns to boost visibility and trust.

Promote express shipping, especially during peak seasons, as high-value customers prefer it.

Use targeted marketing for age groups and customer segments with higher revenue potential.

# Conclusion

This project brings together Python, MySQL, and Power BI to form a complete data analysis workflow.
From cleaning raw data to uncovering meaningful insights, the analysis provides a clear understanding of customer behavior and helps support smarter business decisions.
